## Four Musketeers: Weekly Scrum Report 4/14
Team Member Name: Eric Arreola

What I did since last weekly scrum:
-  Our group started heading towards an idea of chess within GreenFoot so I learned some of the principles of chess since that is something I am not too familiar with. I also looked for some examples on GreenFoot that we could potentially use as our base code since the one we had originally found was not very good. I also then looked into potential expansions or addons we could make to the classic game of chess that would make our version of the game unique.

What I plan to do this week:
-  Our starter code needs to be translated from Slovak so I am translating my designated section of the source code into English. I am also still looking into additions we could make to the base game of chess that would be feasible with the time we have for the project.

What blockers I have:
-  It is difficult to estimate the time it would take for additions to the code since it is in another language so I need to wait until it is fully translated to try and figure out potential timelines along with appropriate ideas for additions in terms of time and effort.

XP Core Value **Respect** : 
- Our group applied the core value of Respect as we took each person's opinion during the process of deciding what to do in terms of project ideas. Everyone gave input and once we decided the general direction we also weighed each others available time to decide what how large we wanted the project to potentially be. No single person's opinion or input was regarded higher than the others. We also evenly divided the intial translating so everyone would feel like a valued team member.
