### Task worked on ###
Tasked completed last week was the code localization refactoring for Chess pieces.
Update the burndown chart such that it displays the correct graph

### Task Planned for next week ###
1. (Spike) figure out the how the chess board code works in depth to target issue [#5 chess board flip lock](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp22-202-four-musketeers/issues/5)
2. Resolve the Pawn promotion bug that was discovered after testing the localization patch [#14 pawn promotion broken](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp22-202-four-musketeers/issues/14)
3. Continue to see if I can improve the burndown chart.

### Blocking items waiting on another team member ###
None

### Scrum notes ###
Since I'm doing feedback, I suggested to the team and they agreed to structure the meetings a bit more than freeflow.
I think our initial structure should be.
1. Any open discussion we want to talk about before meeting?
2. PRs to review
3. Items we're thinking about working on this week and items we have completed.
4. Any blockers?
