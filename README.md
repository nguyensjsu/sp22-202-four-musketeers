## 4/20/2022 ##
John fixed castling. All of the numbers were off. Which cause the need to refactor.

John suggested that all of hte other pieces should be refactored for readability. (Richard) will take this issue.

Eric, record moves. Thinking about using observer pattern. 
Eric discovered that you can only have 1 world at a time. For different levels other people had different "worlds". 

Ryan will do the chess AI near the end. 

What uniqueness can we add to the chess game?
Eric - maybe an additional game mode? AI can duplicate as an additional game mode.

Richard - we can change timer requirements. such as speed chess.

Let's target MVP first.

Features options: potential moves highlighting.
